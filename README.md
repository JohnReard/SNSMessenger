# SNSMessenger
A messenger that allows clients to message each other over a server.

-----FOR BENSON:------

Everytime you start working on the project:
- remember to git pull.
- read this readme to see what has been done.
Everytime you stop working on the project:
- remember to git pull.
- remember to git push.
- write down what you've done and anything that isn't working/needs doing here.

IMPLEMENTED:
- Client sends multiple messages to server.
- Messages are Encrypted.
NEEDS TO BE DONE:
- Messages currently only print on Client, need to print on Server.
- Username and Password verification needs to be implemented (partially implemented with query object).
- Implement guard against availability threats, maybe DDOS protection? e.g retrieve IP, track number of requests and reject socket if too high. Maybe keep a blacklist for repeat offenders?

REPORT NEEDS TO BE COMPLETED.
